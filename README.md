PHP file/folder list with recursive folder search and sort

"sorttable.js" https://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/ (included)

Simply put the files in any directory and it will show the contents including subfolders with content as well!

You'll need a server with PHP or you can run it locally with xampp!
